## PubSub

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Publish-Subscribe pattern in Go.

## Overview

The Publish-Subscribe pattern is a messaging pattern where publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages from topics they have subscribed to. This implementation provides a simple in-memory implementation that allows publishers to send messages to topics and subscribers to receive messages from topics.

## Possible Improvements
 - Error handling in message publish
 - Message publishing retry
 - Make the logging in file system more flexible and customizable
